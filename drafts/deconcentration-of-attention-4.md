# 3. Dimensional vs. Serial

# 3. 多维的 vs. 串行的

Serial thinking correlates well with the term "point of view". Dimensional or non-serial thinking represents the state of having multiple "points of view" on the same issue at the same time.

串行的思考和观点这个术语有天生的联系。而多维的思考或者说非串行的思考代表了对同一个问题同时拥有多个观点的状态。

The key point here is “at the same time”.

这里的关键点是「同时拥有」

Try a simple exercise:

尝试下面这个简单的测试：

- Say "A".
- 说「啊」
- Say "B".
- 说「喔」
- Now, attempt to say both "A" and "B" at the same time.
- 然后，试着同时说出「啊」和「喔」

This exercise displays the problem that serialization causes. Saying "A" excludes saying "B", and saying "B" excludes saying "A". While it is impossible to say "A" and "B" at the same time, a mind has no such limitation and can work with both simultaneously. Thus, it appears that dimensional thinking cannot be directly represented via verbalization. However, this problem is addressed via **common verbalization workarounds**.

这个测试显示了串行带来的问题。说出「啊」和说出「喔」彼此互斥。虽然同时说出「啊」和「喔」是不可能的，大脑并没有这项限制能够并行的进行处理。所以这样看上去多维的思考是不能用语言化来代表的。只是这个问题可以通过**同时语言化**来绕过。

Consider the following statement:

考虑下面这种说法：

"A and B".

「啊」和「喔」

This construct is a common verbalization workaround to serially represent the non-serial structure of having both A and B simultaneously.

这种结构是串行表达非串行结构同时「啊」和「哦」的同时语言化解决方法。

Dimensional thinking poses potential logic problems because multiple points of view could appear to be mutually exclusive.

多维思考有潜在的逻辑问题，因为多个观点之间可能出现彼此互斥。

Consider the dialectical synthesis in philosophy [12].
考虑哲学中的辩证的综合推理
Point of view 1 would be the "thesis".
观点1是一个命题
Point of view 2 would be the "anti-thesis".
观点2是一个反命题
Having them both without logical problems would be called "synthesis".
同时拥有这两个观点而且没有逻辑问题就叫做「综合推理」

It appears that synthesis occurs in a much simpler way at a pure semantics thinking level and, thus, in a non-serial and non-verbal form. However, verbalizing it could require significant efforts.

看上去综合推理在纯粹的语义思考层会非常简单的发生，也就是用一种非串行和非语言的形式。相反，要语言化他会是非常困难的事情。
