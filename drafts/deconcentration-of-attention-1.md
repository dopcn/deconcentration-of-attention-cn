*This article attempts to describe specific mental techniques that are related to resolving very complex tasks in software engineering. This subject may be familiar to some software specialists to different extents; however, there is currently no common consensus and popular terminology for this subject area. In this article, the area is charted from a practical usability perspective.*

*这篇文章尝试描述一些具体的思维方式，这些思维方式与解决软件工程中的复杂任务相关。不同层级的软件专家中的一些人可能接触过这个主题，然而目前针对这一领域还没有通用的共识和术语。在这篇文章中会从实际使用的角度来描述这个领域*

*This article also proposes to treat software engineering itself as research on human thinking because software is meant to simulate thinking.*

*这篇文章也提议将软件工程本身看做对人脑思考的研究，因为软件就是一种对思考的模拟*

#Introduction

#简介

Software engineering is a complex domain. A traditional approach to a complex domain is to split it into relatively isolated parts: structurally – into components and procedurally - into life cycle phases. This way, each individual mind involved in some project can work with a reduced amount of information, which makes the work simpler. This “divide and conquer” approach has historically proven itself to be useful in disciplines such as construction and mechanical or electrical engineering.

软件工程是一个复杂的领域。传统的复杂领域研究方法是将这个领域分解为独立的不同部分：从结构上分为不同的组件，从顺序上分为生命周期的不同阶段。这样，一个研究项目中的每一个个体可以只处理缩减了的信息量，这种方法降低了研究的难度。这种「各个击破」的研究方式在历史上已经被证明在建筑机械电子工程领域是有效的。

With software engineering, however, such an approach was problematic from the start [7]. Software is too pliant, too flexible, too easy to change; thus, it is easily influenced by a constantly changing environment, such as market demands, evolving technologies, human factors, etc.

然而对于软件工程，这种方式从一开始就出现了问题。软件是非常容易受影响的、非常灵活的、非常容易进行修改的。所以，软件很容易持续受到不断变化环境的影响，例如变化的市场需求，技术的革新，人的变动因素等等

Although it might not be very obvious in small projects, developing and maintaining a medium- or large-scale project for a prolonged period of time becomes a significant challenge because there are too many moving parts which end up influencing each other despite all of the efforts to keep them isolated.

虽然在小的项目中不明显，但是长时间开发和维护一个中等规模或者大规模的项目会因为这种影响变得极具挑战，因为有太多的变化因素彼此互相影响，尽管一直以来各个部分都尽可能保持独立。

Software development is typically perceived as a process of “building” a “mechanism”, which employs procedures such as “assemble” and ”disassemble”. However, the more complex the software becomes, the less it resembles a mechanism. A more appropriate term is “organism”. An organism employs other processes aside from a mechanism, such as “growing”. Thus, developing a complex software project does not resemble a process of “building a mechanism”, but a process of “growing an organism”. Even worse – it could resemble the process of growing an organism that is constantly mutating into something else. The “divide and conquer” approach does not work well when growing an unknown organism.

软件开发一般被认为是「构建一个机械装置」的过程，包括了组装和拆卸过程。然而软件越复杂它越不像一个机械装置。更贴切的比喻是「生物体」。生物体包含了机械装置没有的过程例如「生长」。所以开发一个复杂的软件项目不像「组装一个机械装置」的过程，更像是「培养一个生物体」。更坏的情况下可能像是培养一个不断变化为不同东西的生物体。「各个击破」的方式对于培养未知的生物体效果不佳。

There were several major attempts to tackle the complexity of software engineering in a “traditional” manner [6]. However, none of these attempts appear to have succeeded, at least with respect to becoming popular among practitioners. Instead, we now have the “Agile Manifesto”, which states “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”.

已经有几个主要的限制软件工程复杂度的传统方式，但是这些方式似乎都不成功，至少没能在使用者之间流行起来。反倒是现在我们有了「敏捷宣言」，宣扬「个体和互动高于流程和工具」

We are still facing the fact that one of the biggest challenges of software engineering is the ability of an individual mind to handle extraordinarily big loads of information on a daily basis.

我们仍然面临着在软件工程中一个个体每天要处理巨大信息量的这个巨大挑战。

We do see that some people are capable of dealing with this type of challenge. There are specialists who simply “can make things work”. There is no rationale behind this, just the reputation. It sometimes appears to others that such individuals could be considered “weird”.

我们也见到过有些人是有能力处理这种挑战的。有些专家就是能「搞定」。虽然没有经过合理的测量但是他们拥有这样的名声。有些时候这样的人会被别人认为是个怪人。

There are two reasons for studying this subject. The first reason is to be able to consciously train and hone the skill of resolving very complex and even “unresolvable” tasks.

研究这个领域有两个原因。第一是可以有意识地训练加强处理复杂甚至是「不可能完成」任务的能力。

The second reason is to avoid undesirable side effects of such activities. For example, many software specialists are affected by such things as sleeping disorders, de-socialization, emotional instability and other problems that might be directly related to the types of mental activities that they are involved in.

第二个是避免这种能力带来不好的附带作用。例如，很多软件专家都会被失眠，不善社交，情绪不稳定困扰，还有其他特定精神活动中会引起的问题。

Approaching the subject seems to be possible via the conscious manipulation of attention. While the concentration of attention is a relatively known subject, the opposite act of deconcentration of attention appears to be the key technique for reaching specific mind resources, which are unreachable otherwise.

通过有意识的控制注意力探究这个领域看上去是可行的。虽然集中注意力是一个相对已知的主题，他的反面分散注意力的能力看上去是获取大脑特定资源的关键技能，和唯一技能
