Deconcentration of attention in mental space appears to be the key technique to address the specific phenomena that are described in this article.

在大脑中的注意力分散是解决本文所描述问题的关键因素。

This type of deconcentration allows holding attention on a large system that consists of many elements (hundreds or even thousands). It allows the data to be structured in a dimensional manner by providing an opportunity to maintain attention on multiple points of view simultaneously. It also provides a way to interact with background thinking because deconcentrated attention is a better tool to track elusive and vague background mental signals.

这种类型的分散可以应对由成百上千元素组成的巨大系统。注意力的分散为同时在多个对象上保持注意力提供了机会，这样数据就可以以多维的方式组织起来。注意力的分散也为与潜在思考互动提供了一种方法，因为分散注意力是更好的追踪模糊难以找到的潜在大脑信号工具。

One way to see the difference between the conscious and subconscious is to see it as a difference between the foreground and background. Concentration is the tool to work with the foreground. Deconcentration is the tool to work with the background.

一种对比意识和潜意识的方法是类比前景和背景的区别。集中是在前景中工作的工具，分散是背景中工作的工具。

Deconcentration in a sensory space typically starts from the perceptual boundaries and then spreads towards the center. Such direction, from the boundaries towards the center, ensures that the peripheral areas receive the same amount of attention as the center, which is the goal. Deconcentration in mental space also appears to rely on boundaries. However, while in sensory space the boundaries are defined by certain physical limitations, such as the visual field of view, the mental boundaries are quite arbitrary. The smaller boundaries are easier to handle, while wider boundaries provide more opportunities for addressing the task. It is also possible to adjust boundaries during the task resolution process, which makes things even trickier.

感官领域的分散通常从感知的边界分散到中心。这种从边界到中心的方向保证了感知边界区域的注意力和中心一样多，这也是分散的目的。在大脑中的分散也依赖于边界。然而，在感官空间中边界可以由物理的限制定义，例如视野范围，精神边界是非常模糊的。更小的边界更容易处理，但是更大的边界为解决问题提供了更多的可能。随着解决问题的进行边界的范围可能会不断变化，增加里问题解决的难度。

Examples of what could provide boundaries in software engineering are the task, the project, and the individual’s overall knowledge of computer science (CS).

在软件工程中能够扮演边界的例子有：任务，项目和个人对计算机科学的整体了解。

Deconcentration over ones total CS knowledge is required for a technical architect to produce global project decisions.

一个技术专家需要在整体计算机知识上的分散来进行项目整体的架构决策。

Project-based deconcentration uses existing project limitations as deconcentration boundaries. Examples of such limitations are the project programming languages, the third-party components, the protocols of exchanging data, the project architecture, and even in general “the way things are done” in a certain company. The more time that specialists spend on a project, the better is the mental image of a project, that they accumulate in their mind. At some point the quality of this mental image enables instantaneous discovery of a solution for most of the regular project tasks.

基于项目的分散使用项目存在的限制作为分散的边界。限制的例子是编程语言，第三方模块，数据交换协议，项目结构，甚至更广泛的在一家公司做成事的方式。专家在一个项目上投入的时间越多，通过不断的积累在大脑中对项目整体的形象就越清晰越好。积累到一定程度这种大脑中的整体形象可以迅速找出有关这个项目一般问题的解决方案。

Task-based deconcentration occurs when a person does not know the project or some area well and needs to accomplish various researches that are related to the task. After a sufficient number of directions are researched, they form the deconcentration boundaries used to discover a solution.

基于任务的分散发生于当一个人并不了解一个项目或者一个领域，需要进行有关任务的多重研究时。在足够多的方向被研究之后，这些就构成找到解决方案的分散边界。

Yet another approach for defining the boundaries for the mental deconcentration is to use several potentially opposite “points of view” (mentioned in chapter 3 “Dimensional vs. Serial”) as the boundary points where the deconcentration starts. The following section describes what it would look like.

另一种定义精神分散边界的方法是用多种潜在对立观点作为分散开始的边界点。接下来一节将描述这是怎么样的。
