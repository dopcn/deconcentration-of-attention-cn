Probably one of the most powerful and mysterious abilities that a mind has is that of resolving a task without any direct involvement of conscious attention. Using this ability is also the most tiring practice, but it is quite efficient when approaching “unresolvable” tasks.

大脑神秘而强大的功能之一是解决一个问题而不经过有意的思考。能真正运用起来这个能力是不容易的，但是当要解决「不可解决」的问题的时候这种能力是非常高效的。

An “unresolvable” task does not necessarily mean that there is no solution. This term rather means that we do not see a solution. Practice says that, in a complex system with many alternatives, there is typically always a solution. The solution may be tricky to discover, however, because we must “scan” the hundreds or thousands of elements that are involved. 

一个「不可解决」的问题并不意味着没有解决方法。这个术语只是说明我们还没有一个解决方法。实践证明，在一个有许多面的复杂系统中，任何问题总会有一个解决方法。只是这个解决方法可能不容易被发现，因为我们要考虑到成千上万的相关因素。

With background thinking a mind is given a goal, loaded with data, and after some time (days, weeks, months, years), the result appears. A specialist attempts to "hit" the "unresolvable" problem from various angles while the mind accumulates data. A specialist may also stop and do something else that is unrelated to the task. Although the specialist may not notice any progress at all, at some point the solution simply appears, seemingly out of nowhere.

在潜在思考中大脑设定好了目标，载入了数据，在一段时间之后结果就自然而然出现。一个专业人员在尝试从不同的角度去解决「不可解决」的问题的时候大脑就积累了原始数据。然后专业人员停下来做一些与任务无关的事情。虽然他没有有意地推进进度，但是在某一个节点答案自然而然就出现，完全不知道从哪里来的。

Psychologically speaking background thinking is the use of “subconscious” resources for storing and processing data.

从心理学上讲潜在思考是利用潜意识进行存储和处理数据。

In most cases, the background thinking is triggered by emotions. While emotions can certainly be involved in other types of work, the link is the most obvious with background thinking. Emotions act as a “fuel” for the background thinking.

在大多数情况下，潜在思考是由情感激发出来的。虽然情感与其他许多方面都有联系，但是与潜在思考的联系是最明显的。情感是潜在思考的能源。

Many accomplished specialists have a strong emotional attachment to the project that they are working on. They have “a romance with the project". Or they perceive a project as their “pet”.

许多有成就的专业人员与他所从事的项目有很强的情感联系。他们与自己的项目恋爱，或者把项目当做他们的宠物。

Emotions can be triggered by all of the different possible types of reasons. They key point here is that emotions usually make this phenomenon occur. However, there could be alternative ways of triggering background thinking consciously.

情感可以被各种不同的原因唤起。这里的重点是说情感往往可以促使这种现象发生。当然也会有其他有意触发潜在思考的方法。

The use of background mind resources appears to have its price. Background thinking is responsible for many other areas of personal life, and using it deliberately on a specific task could make it fail somewhere else. It seems as though the background processes are sorted by their importance to biological survival. Thus, what is less important fails first.

使用潜在思考的能力也是有代价的。潜在思考要负责个人生活其他许多方面，有意地在某个任务上使用会使得其他方面可能失败。潜在思考会根据这些方面对于生存的重要性排序，那些不重要的方面会首先失效。

Some of the typical candidates for failure are sophisticated social behavioural patterns. Social life has many complex protocols of its own, which include behavioral rituals, dress codes, and knowledge of common discourses. Often, a technical “nerd” may give away all or some of this sophistication to free up some “mental space” for the background tasks. This could be acceptable as long as this is a conscious decision and the consequences are accounted for.

可能会失效的方面有复杂的社交行为准则。社交生活有许多复杂的规范，包括行为仪式，着装规范，对常见话题的了解。往往一个技术宅会放弃其中的几方面来为潜在思考清空大脑空间。只要这种行为是有意识和负责任的我们就没什么好说的。
