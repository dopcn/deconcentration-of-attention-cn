## 5.1 History and general description of deconcentration

## 5.1 分散注意力的历史和简介

>  “Deconcentration of attention is opposite to concentration and can be interpreted as a process of dismantling of the figures in the field of perception and transformation of the perceptual field into a uniform (in the sense that no individual elements could be construed as a perceptual figure) background.” [3]

> 分散注意力是集中注意力的反面，可以被理解为一个分解感官注意力对象将全部感官对象转换为一个整体背景（也就是说没有某个对象可以成为独立的感官对象）的过程

The term “deconcentration of attention” was introduced by Oleg Bakhtiyarov on the basis of research performed in the 1980s at the Kiev Institute of Psychology, USSR [22]. This term appears to be very well-turned and self-explanatory.

作为一个术语「分散注意力」是由 Oleg Bakhtiyarov 基于 Kiev 心理研究所的研究基础提出的。使用这个术语显得非常合适和易懂。

Deconcentration was originally developed “… as part of training programs for operators in the complex, uncertain, and extreme conditions” [22]. Back in those days, such a definition was mostly related to military and space programs. Times have changed, but in our days some software specialists might recognize “complex, uncertain, and extreme conditions” as a pretty close description of their daily work.

分散注意力最初是用于训练操作人员应对复杂、不确定和极端的情况。在那个时候这个定义主要针对军方和太空项目相关。然而时代已经变了，在我们的时代一些软件专家会发现负责、不确定和极端用来描述他们每天的工作很贴切。

The concept of deconcentration states that as a mind is capable of concentrating its attention on an individual element, a mind can also deliberately de-concentrate its attention. In this way, the attention spreads equally over a certain area, which allows for an efficient approach to some tasks that would be quite difficult otherwise.

分散注意力的概念声明了大脑能够集中注意力在某一件事上，那么它也同样可以有意地分散注意力。分散注意力使注意力平均的分布在一个特定领域，这种方式可以有效地解决一些其他方式很难解决的问题。

Existing studies state that concentrative attention has a maximum capacity of 5-9 objects at any moment [19]. In practice, this capacity is even less for a comfortable level. The ideal target for concentration is one single object. Maintaining concentration on multiple objects simultaneously tires the attention quickly. Addressing multiple objects simultaneously for a prolonged period of time is possible only via deconcentration.

研究表明能够集中的注意力有一个同时5到9个对象的上线。在实际中这个数字可能更小。理想的情况下注意力的对象最好只有一个。同时对多个对象保持注意力会很快耗费完注意力。在长时间同时应对多个对象只有运用分散注意力才能达到。

A good example of a common activity in which a deconcentration of attention occurs to a certain extent is driving a car. Concentrating on anything for too long while driving is dangerous. Instead, a driver spreads attention on everything, without focusing on anything in particular. It is very interesting to notice how deconcentrated attention pinpoints whatever requires concentrative attention at any given moment.

一个常见的分散注意力发生的例子是开车。在开车时长时间集中注意力在一点上是很危险的。相反司机会将注意力分散到任何事情上而不会集中在某一件事情上。分散注意力可以在任意时刻准确的识别出需要注意力的事情是一件很有趣的事情。

It is typically considered that “automatic” or “reflectory” skills, such as driving are acquired via long repetitive training [18]. The research on deconcentration states [3] that this training time could be significantly reduced and that in some cases, a skill could even be acquired without any repetition. This quality is important for software engineering because the industry changes very fast, thus demanding serious adaptability skills.

往往这些「自动的」或者「反射性」技能例如开车是通过长时间的重复训练获得的。分散注意力的研究声明这种训练所需要的时间可以显著的缩短，在某些情况下可能甚至不需要重复就可以获得技能。这项技能对于软件工程师来说是很重要的，因为这个行业变化的很快，也就需要更多的适应技巧。

While with concentration objects are sharp and clear, with deconcentration there are no objects, only the background, which could even become blurry and uncertain but being in a certain “state”. This phenomenon occurs in both sensory and mental space. A pragmatic use of deconcentration is learning to properly recognize these “states” and tuning the mind to resolve specific tasks while in this perceptual mode.

集中注意力可以使对象清晰明了，分散注意力则没有了对象只有模糊和不确定的背景，但是出于特定的状态。这种现象在感官的和精神的空间都会出现。分散注意力实在的用途是学习合理的识别这些状态调整大脑在这些状态下处理特定的问题。

One more problem with using certain deep forms of deconcentration, is that the mind stops caring or being concerned with any individual element in the field that it perceives. A concern about anything in particular immediately draws concentration toward that individual element, which breaks deconcentration. Thus, a deconcentrated mind must maintain certain indifference toward the area it is deconcentrated over. This brings up the question of how can a mind work on a task if it stops caring about it? This problem is discussed later in this article.

深入分散注意力的问题之一是大脑会停止关心注意所处理的单个对象。对单个对象的注意会立马打破注意力的分散。所以分散注意力的大脑必须保持对要处理领域的漠不关心。这就带来一个问题，如果一个大脑对于不关心一个任务它怎么会解决它？这个问题我们稍后会讨论到。

Deconcentration of attention in a sensory space (visual, aural or tactile) has many areas of applicability. For software engineering tasks, however, we need to be able to deconcentrate in mental space as well.

分散注意力在感官空间（视觉的，听力的和触觉的）有许多应用领域。对于软件工程师来说，我们需要在大脑中进行分散注意力。
