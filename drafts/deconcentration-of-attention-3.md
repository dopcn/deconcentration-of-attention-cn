# 2. Pure Semantics vs. Verbalization

# 2. 纯粹语义 vs. 语言表达

The process of thinking is sometimes associated with the verbal representation of information:

有的时候思考的过程与用语言表达思想紧密相连

According to wikipedia.org:

引用 wikipedia.org:

> "In popular usage mind is frequently synonymous with thought: the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on "inside our heads.""

> 在日常用法中大脑和思想经常作为同义词：指的是在我们自己的脑袋里自己与自己的对话 

A more precise statement would be that verbalized text is the most common media for preserving and communicating thinking results.

一个更准确的说法应该是语言性的文字是保存和交流思想最常见的媒介。

Alternative media, such as symbols, pictures or even music, are not as highly evolved and typically play a complementary role to verbalized text, which is an unquestionable monopolist in representing knowledge in our days.

其他的媒介，例如符号、图片甚至音乐，都没有语言文字强大通常是作为补充的角色，语言文字在今天作为知识的垄断代表是无可动摇的。

The monopoly of verbalization drives a tendency to associate thinking with verbalization. What also adds to this point is the constant “talking” that a human mind is trained to render all of the time within itself.

语言文字这种垄断催生了一种将思考和语言化结合的趋势。人大脑不断接受讲话的训练也加深了这种趋势。

Some researchers, however, point that it is incorrect to associate thinking with verbalization [2,4]. Verbalized text can be seen as a **data format**, while the actual thinking occurs in some other form.

然而，有一些研究者认为将思考和语言化对等是错误的。语言化的文字可以被看做是数据格式，而真正的思考是以其他形式进行的。

Let’s try an exercise to explore the various alternatives a mind has.

我们通过一个测试来探索一下大脑拥有的多种不同概念。

**Exercise 2.1: Thinking levels**

**测试 2.1： 思考层次**

The exercise below is performed with closed eyes.

下面的测试需要闭着眼睛进行

1. Pronounce the word "red" to yourself in your mind.
1. 在你的大脑中说出红色这个词语
2. Imagine any arbitrary red object (e.g. a hat, a car, a flag) without naming it.
2. 随便想象出一个红色的物体但不要命名它
3. Try to imagine an abstract red color, without naming it or imagining an associated object.
3. 试着想象抽象的红色，不要命名它同时也不要联想相关的物体
4. Try experiencing red without visualizing it, naming it or imagining associated objects.
4. 试着感知红色而又不会将它视觉化，命名它或者联想相关的物体
5. Go back to step 3 – imagining an abstract red color.
5. 回到第3步——想象一个抽象的红色
6. Go back to step 2 - imagining any red object.
6. 回到第2步——想象一个红色的物体
7. Go back to step 1 – pronouncing “red” to yourself.
7. 回到第1步——说出红色这个词语

Keep repeating these steps for at least a few minutes, paying special attention to step 4. The other steps are there to facilitate keeping attention focused on the selected subject (a red color).

用几分钟的时间重复几遍这些步骤，特别关注一下第4步。其他的步骤都是帮助你可以将注意力放在红色这个对象上。

Step 4 can be difficult in the beginning. One of the reasons for this difficulty is that the pure semantics mental sensation of the color is not something new to the mind. It has always been there but most probably was never isolated by attention before. Some struggle could be necessary to rid attention of its habit of ignoring these sensations.

一开始的时候进行步骤4可能很困难。困难的原因是虽然大脑对于红色纯粹语义上的感知并不新鲜，但是可能从没有被特别被注意力分离出来过。需要一些努力才能转变注意力忽略掉纯粹语义的习惯。

One trick to help focusing attention on these sensations is to experiment with other colors and try to notice the associated mental sensations as they change. Picking other subjects (such as figures, sounds, or software engineering entities) might also help because people are different and colors may not be the easiest subject to start with for everyone.

一个可以帮助大脑集中注意力在纯粹语义上的技巧是用其他颜色一起同时测试，并且注意颜色变化时大脑感知的变化。联想一些其他物体可能也有帮助，毕竟每个人是不同的颜色可能并不是对每个人来说最好的切入点。

The final goal is to be able to pick an arbitrary color as a mental sensation, without visualizing it, naming it or imagining associated objects and then to consciously either name the color, visualize it, or imagine an object.

最终的目标是大脑能够首先拥有任意一种颜色的纯粹语义感知，然后有意识的命名这个颜色，将它可视化或者联想相关的物体。

The following diagram reflects the mental structure for the above exercise.

下面这张图反映了这个测试的思维结构

The verbalized level is what is commonly perceived as "thinking". Simulating sensory objects can be referred to as "figurative thinking".

语言化这一层通常被认为是思考。模拟可感知的物体则被成为图形化思考。

The most interesting level for our tasks is the **pure semantics** level [15,2,4].

对于我们来说最感兴趣的层级是纯粹语义层。

The distinctive feature of the pure semantics thinking level is that the information it contains is not in any way verbalized, symbolized or sensually simulated.

纯粹语义思考层与其他层不同的特征是它处理的信息不会是语言化的符号化的或者被模拟感知的。

One common example of the pure semantics experience is the "code-switching problem", which is well known to linguists [8]. When a multilingual person must switch to a language that this person has not used for a while, the mind needs some time to "switch" to an alternative verbalization schema. There is a unique sensation of "hanging between languages". This verbalization gap is perhaps one of the best moments when many individuals had a clear sensation of the pure semantics thinking level. It is a very specific sensation when a person understands perfectly what she is trying to say but the words are not being "rendered" for some reason.

基于纯粹语义思考有一个常见的例子是「语言转化问题」，这在语言学家中很出名。当一个掌握多语言的人要转化到一个他一段时间没有使用过的语言时，大脑需要一些时间去转化到另一套语言化的模式。这之中就有一个处于两种语言之间的特殊时刻。这种语言切换的间隙或许是一个人感知纯粹语义思考层最佳的时机。一个人非常清楚自己要说什么但是因为某种原因词语还没有想好的过程是可以明确的感知到的。

Because of its completely de-materialized nature, the pure semantics level is, therefore, the hardest level to notice consciously. The pure semantics level does produce its specific mental sensations, but they do not have direct sensory or verbal analogues.

因为这种完全的去实际的特质，纯粹语义感知层是最难有意识认识到的一层。但是纯粹语义层是会产生具体的思维感知的，只是这种感知没有直接的触觉和语言化的对应物。

To address this situation, a mind commonly produces two supportive phenomena: **spontaneous sensory simulation** and **spontaneous verbalization**.The latter is the constant "talking" that a human mind typically produces within itself all the time.

为了应对这种情况，大脑通常会产生两种效应：同步的触觉模拟和同步的语言化。后者就是大脑通常所做的在大脑中不断得对自己说话。

Let’s adapt Exercise 2.1 to software engineering. In a certain respect, reaching the pure semantics level is easier in this case because most of the software engineering subjects are immaterial and do not have any direct sensory analogs. However, it is still a good idea to split the exercise into multiple steps or phases because switching these phases makes it easier for the attention to stay focused on one subject for a long time.

下面我们将测试 2.1 改编为软件工程版。从一方面讲，这种情况下达到纯粹语义层会更容易，因为在软件工程中的对象都是没有实体和直接的触觉感知的。但是我们还是将测试分为多步，因为每一步的切换都可以帮助注意力长时间集中在一个对象上。

**Exercise 2.2: The pure semantics of a Web Server entity**

**测试 2.2：网络服务器的纯粹语义**

The exercise below is performed with closed eyes.

下面的测试需要闭着眼睛进行。

1. Pronounce “Web Server” to yourself in your mind while doing the following three things:
1. 在你的大脑中对自己说出「网络服务器」同时做以下3件事
	a. Feel the vocal muscles/tongue moving as if you are really pronouncing these words.
	a. 感受发音肌肉或舌头的移动就好像你真的在发音一样
	b. Imagine hearing the sound of the words “Web Server” as you pronounce them.
	b. 想象你听到了自己所说出的「网络服务器」这个词语
	c. Keep your attention on the meaning, on the sense of what a “Web Server” is.
	c. 保持注意力在「网络服务器」是什么上
	Repeat the phrase like this for a several times.
	像这样重复这一层几遍
2. Now, remove the (a) sensation that you are pronouncing these words. You still hear the imaginary sound of the words, and you still retain the meaning of “Web Server”.
2. 然后去掉想象你在发音的感知。你依然能听到想象中的发音依然保持注意力在「网络服务器」是什么上
Repeat the phrase like this several times.
像这样重复这一层几遍
3. Now, also remove the (b) the sound of the words. What is now left is the meaning of a “Web Server” – its purely semantic mental sensation.
3. 然后去掉词语的发音。只剩下了什么是「网络服务器」的意义，这就是纯粹语义的感知。
Hold this sensation for the same amount of time that you spent pronouncing the phrase, but now do not pronounce the words anymore, and do not visualize anything.
保持这种状态和前面听到发音的时长一样，但是不要发音也不要可视化任何东西
Experience the meaning of a “Web Server” like this several times.
重复几遍体验「网络服务器」的意思
4. Go back to step 1.
4. 返回步骤 1

Repeat the entire cycle several times, paying special attention to step 3.

重复这个循环几次，特别关注步骤 3。

Once you have experimented with “Web Server” for some time, try a “Database Server”. The goal is to keep these subjects in mind clearly and comfortably without naming them until there is a need. They stay in mind as meanings, senses, mental sensations, pure semantics.

使用「网络服务器」测试几次之后，试试换成「数据库服务器」。目的是能够自在清楚得在大脑中保存概念而不用命名他们，直到有必要去命名。这些概念在大脑中就是纯粹的语义。

The advantage of the pure semantics level is the ability to address knowledge in very efficient ways. For example, the “Web Server” entity is, verbally, simply two words. Describing its background context would require books of text. The pure semantics sensation can include the mental figure of “Web Server” along with all of its background in just one sensation, which is very impressive. Here is how it happens.

在纯粹语义层思考的优势是能够以非常高效地方式处理知识。例如说，「网络服务器」仅仅是 5 个字，但是描述他的整个背景需要几本书的文字。而纯粹的语义感知可以包括「网络服务器」的意思和整个背景，这是令人印象深刻的，下面是这一过程是如何进行的
